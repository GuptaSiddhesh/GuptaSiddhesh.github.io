<p> 
Have you ever wondered what grades you can get in a Computer Science course ? Have you ever thought how much work I need to put into this class to get a particular grade. If not we are sure that you must have thought about this while taking CMSC 351 with the great Cldye Kruskal or some similar/comparable course. At University of Maryland, every comp-sci student can either be seen banging their head with a wall or thinking about dropping computer science as a major.

  With student's grade data we will like to determine what grade a particular student can get in a Computer Science course given the student's performance in past Computer Science Courses (Pre-Requisites or Gateway Courses). We want to answer the question that are grades and performance in a course correlated to the performance in the pre-requisite courses for that course ? 
  
  If our model is reasonabaly successful, we can provide insights to students which can prove very helpful when taking some important decisions. For E.g. A student can know that historically other students who have a similar performance to them have ended with a X grade in the class. So student can think and decide ok, I will have to put in more work than usual to earn a better grade than this. Or currentlly I am at this standing, should I drop the class ? And sometimes its just peace of mind and anxiety buster to know where you stand and where you can end-up at the end of the semester.
  
  These decisions have a significant impact on your college plan, graduation, and even your GPA.
