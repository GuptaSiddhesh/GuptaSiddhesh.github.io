<p> 
Have you ever wondered what grades you can get in a Computer Science course ? Have you ever thought how much work I need to put into this class to get a particular grade. If not we are sure that you must have thought about this while taking CMSC 351 with the great Cldye Kruskal or some similar/comparable course. At University of Maryland, every comp-sci student can either be seen banging their head with a wall or thinking about dropping computer science as a major.

  With student's grade data we will like to determine what grade a particular student can get in a Computer Science course given the student's performance in past Computer Science Courses (Pre-Requisites or Gateway Courses). We want to answer the question that are grades and performance in a course correlated to the performance in the pre-requisite courses for that course ? 
  
  If our model is reasonabaly successful, we can provide insights to students which can prove very helpful when taking some important decisions. For E.g. A student can know that historically other students who have a similar performance to them have ended with a X grade in the class. So student can think and decide ok, I will have to put in more work than usual to earn a better grade than this. Or currentlly I am at this standing, should I drop the class ? And sometimes its just peace of mind and anxiety buster to know where you stand and where you can end-up at the end of the semester.
  
  These decisions have a significant impact on your college plan, graduation, and even your GPA.

<h2> Data Collection</h2>
<p>
A student's acadmic records are goverened by many privacy laws, including FERPA. FERPA is a Federal law that protects a student's education records. It may only disclose a student's educational record if he or she has given written consent to do so. We requested for anonymized data from the school, but due to these laws we couldn't get access to such data. We had to do it the harder way - survey people for their data. Then we made a google form to collect grades for each course they took.
